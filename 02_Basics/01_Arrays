// ARRAYS

const myArray=[0,1,2,3,4,5]

// Documentation For Arrays 
/*
1.JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types.
2.JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed using 
arbitrary strings as indexes, 
but must be accessed using nonnegative integers..
i.e you can acces myArray[1] but not in this way myArray["one"]
3.JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed
    ----------------- INTERVIEW CONCEPT---------------------------
4.JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies(Same reference point i.e heap concept). 
(All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies,
rather than deep copies(Different reference point i.e stack concept)).

console.log(myArray) // [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
console.log(`${typeof myArray} and value is ${myArray}`) // object and value is 0,1,2,3,4,5

// Slice Splice

console.log("A ",myArray)   //  [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]

const myn1 = myArray.slice(1,3)
console.log(myn1)         // [1,2]

const myn2 = myArray.splice(1,3)
console.log(myn2)         //[1,2,3]
console.log("C ",myArray)   //  [0,4,5,6]

/* ----------------------------IMP Inteview Question-------------------
Question- Diffrence Between Slice And Splice
Ans- Everyone Says That slice does not include last index but splice include...
  BUT>>>>>  It is not correct answer..
  slice just make a copy and give to newarray but splice remove the specified content from original array.
  i.e splice manipulate the original array but slice does not.
