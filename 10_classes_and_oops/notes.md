JavaScript, as of recent versions, does indeed have classes. However, it's important to understand that JavaScript's classes are essentially syntactic sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance system. They provide a more familiar syntax for defining object blueprints, making it easier for developers who are used to class-based languages like Java or C++ to work with JavaScript.
