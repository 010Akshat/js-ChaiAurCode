//___________________________WHAT IS PROTOTYPE IN JS? (ChatGPT)____________________________________
// In JavaScript, a prototype is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. 
// Every JavaScript object has a prototype property, which makes it possible for one object to inherit from another object.

// When you create an object in JavaScript, it is associated with a prototype object. This prototype object is used as a 
// fallback source for properties and methods that are not found directly on the object itself. 
// If a property or method is not found on the object, JavaScript will look for it on the object's prototype, 
// and if it's not found there, it will continue up the prototype chain until it reaches the top-level Object prototype.

// You can think of prototypes as a blueprint or template for objects. When you create a new object using a constructor function 
// or the class keyword, the newly created object inherits properties and methods from its prototype.

// Prototypes are fundamental to JavaScript's object-oriented programming model and are used extensively, 
// especially in constructor functions, inheritance, and prototype-based inheritance patterns.

Write_____
const newHero=['hulk','spiderman']

Then Write______

newHero
(2)Â ['hulk', 'spiderman']
0: "hulk"
1: "spiderman"
length: 2                                     // This length is property of array newHero 
[[Prototype]]: Array(0)                       // Here ProtoType chaining start (prototypes inside prototype)


-> JavaScript Behaviour is prototypal behaviour.
->What is this prototypal behaviour?
If a property or method is not found on the object you created , JavaScript will look for it on the object's prototype, 
and if it's not found there, it will continue up the prototype chain until it reaches the top-level Object prototype 
or it found the null.  It is referred to as prototyple inheritance.

-> 'New Keyword' , classes , 'this' and prototypal inheritance are all because of prototypes.

Example of prototypal inheritance through code (ChatGPT):

// Parent object constructor
function Person(name, age) {      // functions are objects
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Adding a method to the prototype of Person
Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
};

// Creating a new object using the Person constructor
var john = new Person("John", 30);

// Calling the method inherited from the prototype
john.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is John

_______________________________________________________________
Due to prototypal inheritance , everything in JS is object because at last prototypal inehritance 
will ultimately end at object prototype.
 
Array -----> Object---->NULL(no further parent)
String -----> Object---->NULL(no further parent)
function -----> Object---->NULL(no further parent)
-->All the properties available to object are also available to array , string or function as it inheritance.
*/
function multiplyBy5(num){
  return num*5;
}

multiplyBy5.power=2; /* we have declared function but we use . access with object , so is function a object?
Ans is YES.....  function is also object and it possible */

console.log(multiplyBy5(5));  // 25
console.log(multiplyBy5.power); // 2 , hence function is object also 
console.log(multiplyBy5.prototype); // {}
// That {} , is by default context of .prototype. {} <-- is 'this' of method.
// In short , properties of prototype and the context is available. 





// Again , at the end of end due to prototypal inheritance everything mets at object prototype, hence function can behave as object.
//Their is no further inheritance over object. It is like end .After it ,Object Prototype is NULL.
